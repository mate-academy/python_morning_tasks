On the screen you see two variables `length` and `width`. Declare two new variables and assign them values:
- `sum`, which will calculate the sum of the `length` and `width` variables
- `difference`, which will calculate the difference between `length` and `width`

**_Hint_**:  Be careful when writing the length variable. Don't mix up the letters ðŸ˜€
