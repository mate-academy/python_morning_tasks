You see four variables on the screen. In this task, we will practice variables and write data of different types to them.  

Assign values to them: 
- `first_name` with some **_string_**, for example - `"Alex"`
- `age` with some **_integer_**, for example - `25`
- `height` with some **_integer_**, for example - `180`
- `is_married` with some **_bolean_**, for example - `False`

**_Hint_**:  Do not forget that strings must be written in quotation marks, and Boolean values in capital letters.
