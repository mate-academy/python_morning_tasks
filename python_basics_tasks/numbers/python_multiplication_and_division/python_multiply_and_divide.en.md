On the screen you see two variables `length` and `width`. Declare two new variables and assign them values:
- `multiplication`, which will calculate the product of the `length` and `width` variables
- `division`, which will calculate the result of dividing `length` and `width`

**_Hint_**:  Be careful when writing the variables. Don't mix up the letters ðŸ˜€
